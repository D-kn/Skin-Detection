# Skin-Detection using Bayes and LAB Space
## 1. Description
In this work, a skin detection application has been created in the images. For that,
we first build a base of examples of "skin" and "non-skin" and learn it with
your program. Then we learned the color of the skin using the space
CIE LAB colors (A-B components only).
For more information on the skin detection methods we used please read the following article:

(see section 2 on color spaces and section 3 on the construction of
skin models)
This work is directly inspired by this article, so feel free to read it for ideas and ideas.
